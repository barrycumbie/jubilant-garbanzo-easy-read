# updated: dev george data read
_reading data for dev easy ü¶≠_

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get your data. 

- For this one, I already got a start on dev-able with my "parking log" app. 
- I went back to check it the [app](https://barrycumbie.github.io/supreme-sniffle-solutions/dev-able-solution.html) 
  - and found my "data", currently hardcoded in `html`

```html
  <!-- now for my list items! -->
  <li class="list-group-item">Th 30 Jan. 9:33 made the loop, parked down street, on street across from golf house, 9:44 in the bldg. They got a whole row blocked off for new const. parking lot but now worky being done...we'll see if they did anything on my walk back</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Tu Jan 28. 10:23. Well thank my lucky stars. Ran later today but a gift of the last spot, 4th from right on back wall!</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Th Jan 23. 9:47 by the mailboxes o'er in those first block of apartments. Am I in mailman's way? No signs. Maybe like 9:44 when made the loop, didn't write down. </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Tu Jan 21. 9:41. hallelujah! Got the last one. Third or so from right facing Wesleyan.</li>
  <li id="firstLog" class="list-group-item">Tu 16 JAN. 10:49 in that spot right by Student Publication building</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <strong>14 JAN.</strong> Made the loop at 10:01, parked at Nobles, in office ~10:12. <em>Clear, sunny, chilly day.</em> Spot opened up by time I walked by it.
  </li>
</ul>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Encode it as a data object

- Now I gotta "encode" this hardcoded data into a data object
- I got two choices
  - 1/ a .js data object, or 
  - 2/ a JSON one. 
- I'll end up using both, but gonna start with the JSON 
  - (and later "feed" it into my .js one)
- First, strip out the 'html'

```diff
- <!-- now for my list items! --> remember, no comments in a "pure" JSON thingy

```

- Got the data isolated! 
- Now to give it the JSON form:
  - add in "key" identifiers for each value with lotta quotation marks and colons and commas

```JSON 
{   
    "date" : "Th 30 Jan",
    "time" : "9:33",
    "note" : "made the loop, parked down street, on street across from golf house, 9:44 in the bldg. They got a whole row blocked off for new const. parking lot but now worky being done...we'll see if they did anything on my walk back"
},
{   
    "date" : "Tu Jan 28",
    "time" : "10:23",
    "note" : "Well thank my lucky stars. Ran later today but a gift of the last spot, 4th from right on back wall!"
},
{
    "date" : "Th Jan 23", 
    "time" : "9:47", 
    "note" : "by the mailboxes o'er in those first block of apartments. Am I in mailman's way? No signs. Maybe like 9:44 when made the loop, didn't write down."
},
{
    "date" : "Tu Jan 21", 
    "time" : "9:41", 
    "note" : "hallelujah! Got the last one. Third or so from right facing Wesleyan."
},
{
    "date" : "Tu 16 JAN", 
    "time" : "10:49", 
    "note" : "in that spot right by Student Publication building"
},
{
    "date" : "14 JAN", 
    "time" : "10:01", 
    "note" : "Made the loop at 10:01, parked at Nobles, in office ~10:12. Clear, sunny, chilly day.</em> Spot opened up by time I walked by it."
}  
```

**üòéCool! **

- Note: I could "refactor" this and get my dates/times consistent or add in other fields
- Anyone try ChatGPT to spit out some sample json? Why not? 

- These are all objects of the same type (all parking log info)
  - notice not "data" anymore. Organized with form = info. 
  - but really I need each of these to be their own thing
- Enter in: an `array of objects`
- One more time, first making it an array

```diff
+ [
{   
    "date" : "Th 30 Jan",
    "time" : "9:33",
    "note" : "made the loop, parked down street, on street across from golf house, 9:44 in the bldg. They got a whole row blocked off for new const. parking lot but now worky being done...we'll see if they did anything on my walk back"
},
{   
    "date" : "Tu Jan 28",
    "time" : "10:23",
    "note" : "Well thank my lucky stars. Ran later today but a gift of the last spot, 4th from right on back wall!"
},
{
    "date" : "Th Jan 23", 
    "time" : "9:47", 
    "note" : "by the mailboxes o'er in those first block of apartments. Am I in mailman's way? No signs. Maybe like 9:44 when made the loop, didn't write down."
},
{
    "date" : "Tu Jan 21", 
    "time" : "9:41", 
    "note" : "hallelujah! Got the last one. Third or so from right facing Wesleyan."
},
{
    "date" : "Tu 16 JAN", 
    "time" : "10:49", 
    "note" : "in that spot right by Student Publication building"
},
{
    "date" : "14 JAN", 
    "time" : "10:01", 
    "note" : "Made the loop at 10:01, parked at Nobles, in office ~10:12. Clear, sunny, chilly day.</em> Spot opened up by time I walked by it."
}
+ ]
```

**üí• Boom! Now an array**

- And now, `objectify` this array

```diff
- [
+ { "parkingData" : [
{   
    "date" : "Th 30 Jan",
    "time" : "9:33",
    "note" : "made the loop, parked down street, on street across from golf house, 9:44 in the bldg. They got a whole row blocked off for new const. parking lot but now worky being done...we'll see if they did anything on my walk back"
},

... 

]
+ }
```

**üìù Note: the `...` is just the elipses to say `more code goes here` **

- Now we've got our hardcoded raw data into a nice JSON format
  - an `object` with `{ ... }`
  - a `key` of `parkingData`
  - with a `value` of an `array` `[ ... ]`
  - where each `array element` is an `object` `{ ... }`
  - each with its own `key/value` pairs: `"date" ... "time" ... "note" ...`

  ## 3Ô∏è‚É£ save that in your repo.

  - I take my `JSON` data object and 
  - put it in a file in my repo
  - mine is `data/parkingData.json` 
  
  **üëÄ see []()

  ## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Now to consume the data in our script

  - I'll start a new file, call it `scripts/readParkingData.js`
  -
